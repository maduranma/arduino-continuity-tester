ARDUINO CONTINUITY TESTER
-------------------------
This is a little code snippet that runs on Arduino to test
continuity between it's own pins. Perfect to find matrix pinouts
or other schematics.

It's important that the pin has  internal pull-up resistors, otherwise
you'd short the pins out and you could burn the controller.
